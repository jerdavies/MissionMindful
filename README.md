# Mission Mindful
*A journey to improve mindfulness and relaxation habits.*

### What will the application do?
Mission Mindful will guide the user through a program of mindfulness exercises and track the user's progress along the 
way. The user will be able to customize their experience by selecting a mindfulness category from which they will be
prompted with a relevant mindfulness exercise to complete. 

There will be **4 categories** of exercises:
- Act
- Breathe
- Notice
- Relax

In addition, the user can add their own exercises so they can tailor
their mindfulness habits.

### Who will use this app?
Anyone who is interested in improving their focus on the 'present moment' and training their brain to have healthier
thought patterns. 

This app is designed for those who want to track their progress and benefit from the gamification and 
structure that the tool provides.

### Why is this project of personal interest?
Today's world is abound with unprecedented noise, distractions, and stimulants. We are consumers of never-ending
information flow, which can be flat-out overwhelming for the mind. For our peak mental health, we can greatly benefit 
from mindfulness techniques that focus and relax our brains.

Personally, I often find myself losing track of my present surroundings as I worry about future possibilities or become
sidetracked with innumerable distractions. Although I employ mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing on an ad-hoc
basis, I would personally benefit from a structured program that I can play along with to develop regular mindfulness
habits.
